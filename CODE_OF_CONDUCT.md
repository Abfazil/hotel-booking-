## Expected Behavior

All members of the HotelEase community are expected to:

### Be Respectful
Treat others with dignity and respect. Differences of opinion are normal, but disrespectful behavior is not. Be mindful of your words, tone, and actions.

### Be Professional and Constructive
Communicate clearly and honestly while remaining professional. Offer criticism thoughtfully and focus on ideas, not individuals.

### Be Inclusive
Encourage participation from everyone. Make space for different perspectives and experiences. Be mindful of accessibility, time zones, and language differences.

### Be Open to Feedback
Take responsibility for your impact. If someone tells you that your behavior caused harm, listen carefully, apologize when appropriate, and work to improve.

### Lead by Example
Your behavior sets the tone. Help build a community that others feel safe joining and contributing to.

The following behaviors are not tolerated in the HotelEase community:

### Harassment or Discrimination
Any form of harassment, discrimination, or exclusion based on personal characteristics is unacceptable.

Hateful, offensive, or demeaning language — including slurs or stereotypes — is prohibited.

### Unwelcome Sexual Attention
Unwanted sexual comments, jokes, imagery, advances, or physical contact are not acceptable in any HotelEase space.
